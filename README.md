The access to NBA player and team tracking data has enhanced the dimensionality of basketball. In this exploration, we analyze the data set using PCA to understand a player’s performance and the correspondence to winning. We also transformed this to calculate a team’s PC score and evaluate a team’s performance across the NBA. After exploring the dataset, we build models that predicts the relationship between a player’s statistics and the position he plays in. There are five possible positions a player can play in: point guard, shooting guard, small forward, power forward, or center. To understand which statistics correlate to position, we used feature engineering and visualizations to depict what features do help and do not help in predicting one’s position. We then created logistic regression models and random forest models to help classify the players based on these features.
